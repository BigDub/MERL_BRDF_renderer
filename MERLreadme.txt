MERL BRDF Database
version 2.0
February, 2006 

This database contains reflectance functions of 100 different materials.
Each reflectance function is stored as a densely measured Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution
Function (BRDF).
 
If you use these measurements, please, reference the following paper:
"A Data-Driven Reflectance Model",
Wojciech Matusik, Hanspeter Pfister, Matt Brand and Leonard McMillan,
ACM Transactions on Graphics 22, 3(2003), 759-769.
